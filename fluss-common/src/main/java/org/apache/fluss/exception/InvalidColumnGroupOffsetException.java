/**
 * Thrown when an {@code appendColumns} write violates the strict-from-EWM ordering invariant — the
 * supplied {@code source_offset} does not equal the next slot after the current per-bucket
 * Enrichment Watermark (EWM). The client typically reaches this state when its EWM cache is stale
 * relative to the leader; on receiving this error, the client batching layer should refresh the EWM
 * and drop any in-flight batches whose first offset is no longer the leader's expected next slot
 * rather than blindly retrying.
